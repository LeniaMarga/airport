## Setup

1. Create a database called airport_manager (createdb airport_manager)
2. Run the SQL script (psql -d airport_manager -f airport_manager.sql)

## Questions

1. Using an inner join, select the flight number and airport name for all the flights

2. Add aliases so that the resulting columns are called flight_number and airport_name

SELECT flights.number AS flight_number, airports.name AS airport_name
FROM airports
INNER JOIN flights
ON airports.id = flights.airport_id

3. Using an inner join, select the flight number and airport name for all the flights that belong to Heathrow

SELECT flights.number AS flight_number, airports.name AS airport_name
FROM airports
INNER JOIN flights
ON airports.id = flights.airport_id
WHERE airports.id = 1

4. Using an inner join, select all the flight and airport details for flight BA1453

SELECT flights.*, airports.*
FROM airports
INNER JOIN flights
ON airports.id = flights.airport_id
WHERE flights.id = 1

5. Using inner joins, select the flight number of the flights that Tom Cruise is on

SELECT flights.number FROM flights
INNER JOIN passengers_flights
ON passengers_flights.flight_id = flights.id
INNER JOIN passengers
ON passengers.id = passengers_flights.passenger_id
WHERE passengers.id = 3



6. Using inner joins, select all of Sian's flight numbers and all of Tom's flight numbers (NOTE: you'll have to us some brackets in the where clause to separate your ANDs and ORs)

SELECT flights.number, passengers.first_name FROM flights
INNER JOIN passengers_flights
ON passengers_flights.flight_id = flights.id
INNER JOIN passengers
ON passengers.id = passengers_flights.passenger_id
WHERE passengers.id = 3 OR passengers.id = 1


7. What changes would you make to the structure of the flights table so that we can identify a flight's departure and destination airports?
